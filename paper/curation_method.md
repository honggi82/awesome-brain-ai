# Awesome Brain AI Curation Method

Generated: 2026-06-30

## Scope

- Topic: relationship between brain structure and AI
- Years: 1900-2026
- Candidate target: up to 1,000 papers per year
- Selection target: 100 papers per year
- Ranking: citation count descending, using Semantic Scholar `citationCount`
- Metadata source: Semantic Scholar Academic Graph bulk search, free public metadata

## Query

For each year, the pipeline starts from broad brain/neuroscience Semantic Scholar candidate metadata, then re-scores records for both brain-structure evidence and AI, machine-learning, computational modeling, graph, decoding, neuromorphic, BCI, or brain-inspired signals. Final yearly selections are citation-ranked within the eligible brain-AI relation pool.

For early years where public metadata contains fewer than the requested target, the generated datasets keep the full audited pool and select all available citation-ranked records rather than fabricating missing entries.

## Enrichment

The script deterministically assigns taxonomy categories, keyword convention tags, key ideas, strengths, and research-focused limitations. No paid API, paid LLM, paid translation service, or paid compute is used.

## GitHub-Awesome Skill2 and Paper-Curation Provenance

This regeneration follows `github-awesome-skill2` in metadata-adapter mode for a large citation-ranked awesome repository while preserving the selected paper set in `data/papers_1900_2026.csv`. The workflow inspected the local `jehyunlee/paper-curation` checkout and is configured for Zotero-free folder-source PDF staging under `E:\議곗꽑?\?곌뎄\paper-curation\paper\awesome-brain-ai`. Full PDF LLM review stages from paper-curation were not run because they require explicit approval for paid or metered APIs.

## Verification Targets

The repository should contain selected and candidate CSV/JSON data, `README.md`, `README.html`, `docs/index.html`, period analysis JSON, taxonomy SVG assets, and English/Korean review HTML files.
